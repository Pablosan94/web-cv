        Hi, my name is Pablo SÃ¡nchez.
        <br><br>
        I was born in Valencia on March 15th, 1994 (currently {{ age }} years old).
        <br><br>
        When I was 5 years old, me and my family moved for a year to Berkeley in the US, where I was lucky enough to pick up on the language since a very young age.
        <br><br>
        Computers have been in my life since I can remember and I have always found them very useful and interesting, which is why I chose Computer Science as my career path.
        <br><br>
        After going through many different hobbies in my teenage years, the one I'm most passionate about is making music and I can play piano, bass, guitar, drums and occasionally sing.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I live in Madrid with my girlfriend and our {{ catAge }} year old cat.
